Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal blog repository. Currently, I have published personal web profile and you see it at https://indrakusuma.web.id/web-profile. That blog was built using old tech stack with many unused animation javascript. The performance also bad because we load all of modules in the first time user access.

The web techology is moving and get better day by day. And this is the reason why I built this repository. I need to keep update my knowledge about web technology. Because, the best way to learning is try to build our own, right? This repository used for my documention of learning Gatsby (React-based) ecosystem.

## TARGETS

current web profile has performance score **65 for mobile** and **85 for desktop** using Google Page Insight.

And I'm have target to achieve **>80 for mobile** and **>90 for desktop** ðŸ˜†

## How to run this project?

Make sure you already installed **Node JS** also **Gatsby-CLI** in your machine and then,

- Copy this repo
- install dependecies, just type `yarn` or `npm install`
- then runninng your project using `gatsby develop` ðŸš€
