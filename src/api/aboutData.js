Hi, I'm Indra 👋 I have more 2 years of professional experience in Web Development, most of my work as Frontend Engineer using various Javascript libraries. 
<br /><br />
Worked with Dian Nuswantoro University, Suara Merdeka and currently at Tokopedia as Software Engineer Web Platform.
<br /><br />
Apart from my IT career, done my bachelor's degree in Technical Informatics from Dian Nuswantoro University, also contribute to a technical forum and collaborate on some open source projects.
<br /><br />
I have a strong interest in leadership, to do things in an organized way, approach to make things perfect by applying best practices and suitable design patterns. Also would like to work where independence was given to an individual so that he can introduce his creativity and way of doing things.
